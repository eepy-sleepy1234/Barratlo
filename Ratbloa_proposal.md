The title of the game is Loatbra.  
I chose this name because it’s an anagram for Balatro, the game it is based off of. In actuality, I have purposefully chosen to spell it differently every time that I write it, and the title screen does the same.

Ortabla fits the puzzle genre because the entire game revolves around trying to figure out how you’re going to be able to score a certain amount of points.

The world of Batorla is a poker table. There is nothing but poker. Your goal: to play poker. There are no people, only you, and the poker table. The blinds are the closest thing you have to human contact. There is no world.

There is no history when it comes to Aolrtba. The only history in this game is the rules of poker, and you don’t even follow them. Don’t like a hand you were dealt? Discard it, this isn’t Vegas. You want to play 5 kings of hearts? Go for it, the deck is what you make it. There is no character to have history, only you–the player–who is here to play some poker.

What is this place?  
This place? It’s a poker table. What more could you ask for?

There are no characters. Only playing cards and jokers.

The antagonists of this game are the blinds, led by the boss blinds with specific debuffs designed to make you lose. These blinds determine the score that you need to win, but only for a while, because it gets real hard real fast.

There are no other key figures.

Anyone can play the game, but it is most definitely suited for teens up, due to the rapid difficulty scaling and deep thinking that the player has to do to win.

The player keeps playing to see the number go up. That is the goal of the game, to make a number get as big as possible. And, oh boy, when it does get up, that sense of accomplishment is unreal.

There are 150 unique jokers that all give different boosts to your game, it takes time to discover and unlock them all.

This game is heavily inspired by Balatro, the gameplay is almost identical, the name is based off of it, everything about this game comes from Balatro, with my own little spin on it.

Its only competition would be Balatro, but the key thing that makes this game unique is that there are a whole new set of jokers.

I hope that players will feel the great joy of watching the number go up.  
In the words of localthunk, the creator of Balatro, “juicy animations”.
